# FSRCNN

Single image super-resolution (SR) aims at recovering a high-resolution image from a single lowresolution image. SRCNN is convolution neural network (CNN) that directly learns an end-to-end mapping between low and high resolution images. And FSRCNN is the acceleration CNN structure of SRCNN.
