# FSRCNN

Single image super-resolution (SR) aims at recovering a high-resolution image from a single lowresolution image. FSRCNN is convolution neural network that directly learns an end-to-end mapping between low and high resolution images.

The following images demonstrate the difference between Bicubic and FSRCNN.
